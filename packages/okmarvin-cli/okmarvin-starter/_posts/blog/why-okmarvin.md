You might be wondering why I would develop another static site generator while there are already hundreds of [them](https://www.staticgen.com/).

## CSS is hard

CSS is hard to maintain, especially when you have a large code base or older one.

That's why I think **scoped CSS**/**CSS in JS** is a much better choice nowadays. We no longer break things we didn't mean to.

## Why not GatsbyJS, etc.

So GatsbyJS alike looks great regarding my CSS demand, why not just use those static site generators?

There is one main reason, they're overkill for simple static site which doesn't have many dynamic UIs. I just don't want to load a total framework runtime for my blog.
